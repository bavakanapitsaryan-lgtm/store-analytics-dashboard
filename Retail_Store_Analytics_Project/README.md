# 🏪 Store Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

This project analyzes retail store performance using SQL for data transformation and Tableau for interactive visualization.  
The goal is to turn raw operational data into actionable business insights covering **customers**, **products**, and **HR performance** — all in one integrated dashboard.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The project focuses on a fictional retail store dataset, analyzed in three key areas:

1. **Customer Metrics** – purchasing behavior, daily order trends, and demographic patterns.  
2. **Product Metrics** – product line performance and sales trends.  
3. **HR Metrics** – employee and office performance insights.

All these insights are brought together into a **single Tableau dashboard**:

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Structured raw CSV data using `Store_ddl.sql`.
   - Executed SQL queries for each metrics area to transform and aggregate data.

2. **Analysis**
   - `1_customer_metrics.sql` → customer orders, demographics, daily trends  
   - `2_product_metrics.sql` → product performance, product line analysis  
   - `3_hr_metrics.sql` → employee and office performance

3. **Visualization**
   - Combined all metrics into a single Tableau workbook: **Store Analytics Dashboard**.
   - Created interactive filters for time, region, and product categories.
